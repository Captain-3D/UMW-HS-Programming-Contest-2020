Problem K - Jaffy Rides His Bicycle
</h1>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
Jaffy loves to bicycle all of the trails close to UMW. He spends so much time bicycling that he failed freshman English twice. He perfectly paces himself on these bike trails, so that no matter the terrain or weather, he pedals at an exact, constant speed. Jaffy is wondering how long it will take him to traverse a bike trail given his speed and the length of the trail.

<h3>

<h3>
