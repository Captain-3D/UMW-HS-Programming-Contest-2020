Problem C - How Tall is Jessie
</h1>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
Jiffy and Jaffy have a young cousin named Jessie. On each Facetime call between Aunt Jessabell, Jiffy, and Jaffy; Aunt Jessabell points her camera at her little daughter Jessie. Jiffy is amazed how much Jessie has grown each time they talk. Giraffes can grow up to 19 feet tall and weigh 2500 pounds. Maybe cousin Jessie will grow this big. The Facetime calls are once per month, and little Jessie grows 6 inches on each call. Little Jessie is 3 feet tall on the first Facetime call. Write a program that computes how tall Jessie is after N Facetime calls.

Output is one line that is the height of Jessie. The height is printed in feet and half feet.
If the height is a whole number, then do not print the number of half feet. The output line is terminated with either a . (period) or an ! (exclamation point). If Jessie's height is greater than 19 feet, terminate the output line with an exclamation point; otherwise, terminate the output line with a period.
