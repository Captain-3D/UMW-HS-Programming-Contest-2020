Problem N - Janny and Jaffy's Wedding
</h1>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
Not only is Janny enrolling at UMW, but Janny and Jaffy are getting married. When Janny received the ring you printed in Problem H, she and Jaffy decided to get married. Giraffes tend to marry early. Jeography is Jaffy's best man, and Jeography has flown to Fredericksburg to help Jaffy with wedding details. Jeography asks Jaffy if they will have sparkling grape juice at the wedding as it is a favourite beverage of giraffes. Giraffes are a bit quirky when it comes to drinking sparkling grape juice, and giraffes have unique taste buds when it comes to drinking sparkling grape juice. Each giraffe only likes to drink sparkling grape juice when it's at a certain temperature as any other temperature doesn’t taste quite right. Each wedding guest has their own drinkable sparkling grape juice temperature.
</p>
<p>
Since Jaffy and Janny want their wedding to be perfect, they will only serve sparkling grape juice at temperatures everyone will enjoy. To make sure everyone is satisfied, they want to provide each giraffe their own bottle at their desired temperature. The refrigerator at the wedding has an internal temperature of 40 degrees F. All of the guests grape juice bottles are in the refrigerator and are exactly 40 degrees. Jaffy knows that every minute outside the refrigerator the grape juice will increase by 0.5 degrees, but the grape juice will not get warmer than the outside temperature. Jaffy wants a list of the times he should remove his friend's grape juice bottles ordered by the amount of time prior to the wedding the bottles should be removed. The guests whose bottles must be removed earlier will appear first in the list. If multiple guest's bottles must be removed at the same time, they must be ordered alphabetically by their names.
