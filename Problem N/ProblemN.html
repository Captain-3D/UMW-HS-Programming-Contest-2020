Problem N - Janny and Jaffy's Wedding
</h1>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
Not only is Janny enrolling at UMW, but Janny and Jaffy are getting married. When Janny received the ring you printed in Problem H, she and Jaffy decided to get married. Giraffes tend to marry early. Jeography is Jaffy's best man, and Jeography has flown to Fredericksburg to help Jaffy with wedding details. Jeography asks Jaffy if they will have sparkling grape juice at the wedding as it is a favourite beverage of giraffes. Giraffes are a bit quirky when it comes to drinking sparkling grape juice. Giraffes have unique taste buds when it comes to drinking sparkling grape juice. Each giraffe only likes to drink sparkling grape juice when it's at a certain temperature as any other temperature doesn't taste quite right. Each wedding guest has their own drinkable sparkling grape juice temperature.
Since Jaffy and Janny want their wedding to be perfect, they will only serve sparkling grape juice at temperatures everyone will enjoy. To make sure everyone is satisfied, he makes sure each giraffe has their own bottle at the temperature they want. The fridge at the wedding has an internal temperature of 40 degrees Fahrenheit and Jaffy knows that every minute outside the fridge the grape juice will be 0.5 degrees warmer. Jaffy wants a list of the times he should pull his friend's grape juice bottles out ordered by how far from the wedding he should pull out the bottles.
