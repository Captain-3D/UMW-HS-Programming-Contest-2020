Problem B - How Many Spots
</h1>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
Jiffy and Jaffyâ€™s Aunt Gingerbread is amazing at counting spots on giraffes. Giraffe spots are mainly for camouflage, but they also contain a patchwork of blood vessels that cool a giraffe. Aunt Gingerbread does not count spots one-by-one. She looks at a giraffe and immediately knows how many spots are on it. Many have asked Aunt Gingerbread to teach them her spot counting trick, but she doesn't know how she does it. Aunt Gingerbread uses her spot counting to teach addition. She counts the spots on two giraffes and teaches others how to add the spots. Write a program that adds the spots of two giraffes.
