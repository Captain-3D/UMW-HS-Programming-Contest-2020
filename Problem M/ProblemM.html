Problem M - Jaffy and Janny Together
</h1>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
During Jaffy's volunteer fire fighting, he saved a prominent citizen of Fredericksburg. In doing so, Jaffy sustained several injuries. The room of the prominent citizen was so high that Jaffy had to use his 20" long tongue to open the door and extinguish the fire. Giraffe's tongues are tough, but the extremely hot door handle severely burned Jaffy's tongue. Also Jaffy's large nasal cavities were scarred when hot embers landed in them. Jaffy was recuperating in Mary Washington Hospital, when the prominent citizen visited with news that they were placing $20,000 into Jaffy's account. When the $20,000 is added to Jaffy's account, he has a total of $20,200 dollars. At this same time Janny texted Jaffy that she had been accepted to UMW, but she needed $18,000 to book a special flight on an airplane that could accommodate the heights of giraffes. Jaffy has healed and he is visiting an ATM to transfer money from his account to Janny's so they can reunite at UMW. He has to enter a correct password to enact the transfer. Help Jaffy perform this bank transaction. There are three password algorithms at the ATM.
1. Passwords can be any length and can be any combination of letters
2. Passwords must be a minimum of 12 characters, and they must contain uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters from the set {!@#$%^&*()_-+}
3. Passwords must be a minimum of 16 characters and the characters must alternate between letter (either uppercase or lowercase) and special characters from the set {!@#$%^&*()_-+}
