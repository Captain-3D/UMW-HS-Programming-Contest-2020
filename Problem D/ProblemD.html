Problem D - Jaffy’s Bored in a CS Class
</h1>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
One day in computer science class, Jaffy got bored with the lecture. The teacher did not allow smart phones in class to keep his mind occupied, so Jaffy started estimating the weight of backpacks of students sitting in a row of desks. Maybe Jaffy can estimate weight like Aunt Gingerbread can count spots. After creating the estimates, Jaffy mentally computed the total number of backpacks in the row, the average weight, the smallest weight, and the largest weight. Write a program that performs Jaffy's mental computations.
</p>
<h3>
Input
</h3>
<p>
The first line of input contains a non-negative integer N giving the number of backpacks Jaffy estimated.
Following that are N lines, each containing an estimated backpack weight.
</p>
<h3>
Output
</h3>
<p>
Output is three lines with (1) the heaviest backpack, (2) the lightest backpack, and (3) the average weight of all backpacks. Output values must be rounded to the nearest tenth. See section Rounding to Nearest 100th and 10th at the end of packet for code to accomplish this.
<h3>
Sample Input
</h3>
<pre>
7
29 
20.1 
2 
34 
12.7 
24.6 
23.2
</pre>
<h3>
Sample Output
</h3>
<pre>
Heaviest backpack: 34.0 
Lightest backpack: 2.0
Average weight of all backpacks: 20.8
