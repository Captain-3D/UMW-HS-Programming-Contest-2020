Problem E - Jaffy’s Gobbling Engine
</h1>
<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
One day in English class, Jaffy is daydreaming instead of paying attention to the teacher. Jaffy envisions a stream of numbers and operators being fed into a Gobbling Engine. Jaffy dreams of his Gobbling Engine becoming famous just like Charles Babbage's Difference Engine - a mechanical computer created in 1820 and programmed by Ada Lovelace. At supper, Jaffy tells Jiffy about his daydream. Jiffy says she can easily write a program that is Jaffy's Gobbling Engine. Jiffy opens her laptop and proceeds to program a Gobbling Engine. You, too, can write a Gobbling Engine.
</p>
<h3>
Input
</h3>
<p>
The first line of input contains a non-negative odd integer N giving the number of lines input to the Gobbling Engine.
Following that are N lines that alternate between a number and an operator. An operator is one of four characters: + - * /. Each character performs the arithmetic operation traditionally associated with it.

<h3>
Output
</h3>
<p>
Output is a number that is the result of the add, multiply, subtract, or divide pattern. Output values must be rounded to the nearest tenth. See section Rounding to Nearest 100th and 10th at the end of packet for code to accomplish this.
